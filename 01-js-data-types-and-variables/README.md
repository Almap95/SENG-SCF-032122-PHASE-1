**Please remember that you will not have to memorize anything in this course. There is no final exam to study for! Just get comfortable utilizing the concepts as you experiment and write code. Be curious and have fun! 😁**

# Data Types and Variables


## SWABTs (short for `Students Will Be Able To`)
- utilize `console.log()` for testing and experimenting
- understand the difference between `let`, `const` and `var`
- identify and differentiate the various JS primitive datatypes (no need to memorize!)
- practice writing conditional statements

---

### Warm Up Question
- If you could only ever have one flavor of ice cream *for the rest of your life*, consider which one it would be. Initialize a variable (i.e., declare and set to a value) accordingly.

### Tips for Debugging (and for asking for help!)

Asking the right questions at the right time: 
1. What am I trying to do/accomplish?
2. What is happening instead?
3. Why do I think this is happening? (Make some assumptions.)
4. What can I change to get closer to what I want to happen?
5. Do I see what I am expecting to see? If not, double back to Step 2.

### VS Code Extensions
Note: you can search for and install all of these at the left side of your VS Code window, below "Run and Debug"

- [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)
    - Browser automatically updates, no need to refresh page

- [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)
    - Once installed: `Shift + Option + F` shortcut in Mac (or `Shift + Alt + f` on Windows) => Automatically formats/indents your code and adds semi-colons at ends of statements. You can customize to leave out any language you want to.

**For those of you looking for VS Code shortcuts for your PC, [here is a link](https://code.visualstudio.com/shortcuts/keyboard-shortcuts-windows.pdf). If you need the cheatsheet for your Mac, you can type `Command+K` and `Command+R` while in VS Code, and the window will open**
