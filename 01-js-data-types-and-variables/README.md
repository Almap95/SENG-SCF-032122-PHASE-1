# Data Types and Variables


## SWABTs (short for `Students Will Be Able To`)
- utilize `console.log()` for testing and experimenting
- identify and differentiate the various JS primitive datatypes (no need to memorize!)
- understand the difference between `let`, `const` and `var`
- practice writing conditional statements for control flow

### Warm Up Question
- If you could only ever have one flavor of ice cream *for the rest of your life*, consider which one it would be. Initialize a variable (i.e., declare and set to a value) accordingly.

### VS Code Extensions
Note: you can search for and install all of these at the left side of your VS Code window, below "Run and Debug"

- [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)
    - Browser automatically updates, no need to refresh page

- [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)
    - Shift + Option + F shortcut in Mac (or Shift + Alt + f on Windows) => Automatically formats/indents your code and adds semi-colons at ends of statements. You can customize to leave out any language you want to.
